When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When collaborating with multiple contributors, using remotes seems essential. Also, I tend to work from different locations (eg on my PC at home vs on my laptop in a coffee shop), so having access to the same work through a remote would be very useful.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I may be working on my own changes on the local repository, and it would be confusing if Git decided to pull other changes introduced on remote. Additionally, pulling automatically would take time/bandwidth that I might not want to spend.
